## About me

Greetings! I'm a dedicated Full Stack Developer with a passion for crafting seamless digital experiences. With 8 years of military service in the US Army and still serving presently in the WA National Guard, my background as a dental hygienist in the army instilled discipline and attention to detailâ€”qualities I bring to my coding endeavors.

Beyond the screen, I find joy in the great outdoors. Whether I'm conquering trails on a mountain bike, carving through snow on a snowboard, or capturing the beauty of nature through my lens in photography, I embrace each moment as a source of inspiration.

As a developer, I thrive on solving complex problems and translating ideas into functional, user-friendly applications. Join me on this journey where technology meets creativity, and let's build something extraordinary together.
